Tasks
0. What is my PID
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. List your processes
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.


2. Show your Bash PID
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, 
thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.


3. Show your Bash PID made easy
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, 
of processes whose name contain the word bash.


4. To infinity and beyond
Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

5. Don't stop me now!
We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, 
there is actually another way to do this.
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.


  
6. Stop me if you can
mandatory
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.


7. Highlander
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays:
To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration

8. Beheaded process
mandatory
Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.


9. Process and PID file
Write a Bash script that:
Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal
  
10. Manage my process
Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in 
the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. 
The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. 
The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.
Write a manage_my_process Bash script that:
Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds
Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. 

11. Zombie
Read what a zombie process is.
Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.
